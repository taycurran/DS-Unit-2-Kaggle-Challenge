    "- [ ] [Review requirements for your portfolio project](https://lambdaschool.github.io/ds/unit2), then submit your dataset.\n",
    "- [ ] Continue to participate in our Kaggle challenge. \n",
    "- [ ] Use scikit-learn for hyperparameter optimization with RandomizedSearchCV.\n",
    "- [ ] Submit your predictions to our Kaggle competition. (Go to our Kaggle InClass competition webpage. Use the blue **Submit Predictions** button to upload your CSV file. Or you can use the Kaggle API to submit your predictions.)\n",

    "3. Use a metric for classification, such as [`scoring='accuracy'`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#common-cases-predefined-values)\n",
    "4. If you’re doing a multi-class classification problem — such as whether a waterpump is functional, functional needs repair, or nonfunctional — then use a categorical encoding that works for multi-class classification, such as [OrdinalEncoder](https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/categorical-encoding/ordinal.html) (not [TargetEncoder](https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/categorical-encoding/targetencoder.html))\n",

    "- Try other [categorical encodings](https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/categorical-encoding/). See the previous assignment notebook for details.\n",
    "- In additon to `RandomizedSearchCV`, scikit-learn has [`GridSearchCV`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html). Another library called scikit-optimize has [`BayesSearchCV`](https://scikit-optimize.github.io/notebooks/sklearn-gridsearchcv-replacement.html). Experiment with these alternatives.\n",

    "\n",
    "> You can even go further in combining GridSearchCV and Pipeline: it is also possible to search over the actual steps being performed in the pipeline (say whether to use StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler). This leads to an even bigger search space and should be considered carefully. Trying all possible solutions is usually not a viable machine learning strategy. However, here is an example comparing a RandomForestClassifier and an SVC ...\n",
